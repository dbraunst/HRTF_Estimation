Azimuth positions are defined using the IRCAM angle measurements- 0º directly in front of the listener, 90º directly to the left of the listener, 180º directly behind the listener, and 270º directly to the right of the listener- because the IRCAM HRIR dataset was used for convolution. The versions will make use of sources binaurally panned in the horizontal plane at 0º,  45º,  90º, 135º, 180º, 225º, 270º and 315º, with the exception of one created using a virtual surround sound technique and one stereo version. The seven iterations were:
1. Pre-Convolution: A version with the effect designed with the mono input signal’s stereo chorus output. The left and right output of the chorus effect were then convolved separately, at the following positions: 
   1. Iteration 1: 90º (L) and 0º (R), 45º (L) and 315º (R), 270º (L) and 180º (R), 135º (L) and 225º (R)
   2. Iteration 2: 90º (L) and 45º (R), 0º (L) and 315º (R), 270º (L) and 225º (R), 180º (L) and 135º (R)
   3. Iteration 3: 90º (L) and 45º (R), 45º (L) and 0º (R), 0º (L) and 315º (R), 315º (L) and 270º (R), 270º (L) and 225º (R), 225º (L) and 180º (R), 180º (L) and 135º (R), 135º (L) and 90º 
2. Iteration 4: Post-Convolution, Pre-Summation: This version first convolved the mono source with the HRTFs at the aforementioned chosen positions along the azimuth plane. The chorus effect was then applied to each of these convolved sources pre-summation of the left and right channels of the final binaural signal. 
3. Iteration 5: Post-Convolution, Post-Summation: This version again began with convolving the mono source with the HRTFs at the chosen positions in the azimuth plane. The chorus effect was placed on the stereo output of the binaural signal, after Left/Right summation.
4. Iteration 6: This version is the stereo output of the chorus, with no HRTF convolution.
5. Iteration 7: Virtual Surround Sound: This version was made similar to the pre-convolution iterations, but convolved the stereo chorus output with HRTFs at positions 0º, 30º, 120º, 240º, and 330º, representing speaker positions in a surround sound setup.
